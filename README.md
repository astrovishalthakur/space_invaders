This is a project I completed on my journey of learning python via project based learning.

<h1>Space Invaders</h1><h3>It is a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. 
It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed by the Midway division of Bally for overseas distribution. 
Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. 
The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.</h3>

<h1>Controls</h1>
<h2> Shoot : Spacebar</h2>
<h2> Move Left: Left key</h2>
<h2> Move Right: Right key</h2>

I have provided some pictures of game in action.
